* change plotting to go top-to-bottom generally?

* add as.mcmc.bugs from emdbook

* create coeftabList?  melt method (for ggplot2 etc.)
* consider (re)implementing lme4a (merMod)
* minimize dependencies on other packages, as much as possible
* FIXME: margin adjustment when vertical=FALSE (staxlab, etc.?)
*       get rid of cruft in coefplot.default?  (leave CI=(1,2) as a special case?)
* legend fixes: reverse order is a bit hokey
* avoid warnings generated by passing coeftab arguments to plot
     [suppressWarnings() if necessary, add explicit arguments,  clean.args,
       lists of arguments ?]
* extract ranef, vcov from lmer/lme objects ?
* ignore.names option in fitList? (or merge.names=TRUE)
* add snarky error message if p values requested with MCMC? or Bayesian p-values?
* ignore 'Std. Error' column in range for coefplot
* ggplot version/examples (fortify??) --
    melt coeflist
* test coeftab.mcmc with a single-parameter model ...
* test coeftab.mcmc with a single-chain model ... does as.mcmc.bugs exist?
  (?? why did this work before?? was emdbook loaded?)

* vignette?
* ggplot examples
* include information on 'terms'; colouring option?
* colour by factor
* rectangles by factor
* return (invisibly) coeftab, y-axis locations
* better model.matrix testing/handling

* ordering coeftabs: by magnitude, Z-score, abs(magnitude)
  (color by sign?)
